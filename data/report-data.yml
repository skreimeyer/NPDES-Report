    preamble: The time series data recorded for the purpose of this permit is complex,
      and meaningful visualization of data is challenging. To assist with interpreting
      useful information from the high levels of noise, the median value of measurements
      is provided with a savgol filter.

    preamble: Distributions of measurements are separated by region. While there does
      appear to be some regional variation in some of the measured parameters, these
      variations do not appear to be indicative of significant water quality concerns.
