The City of Little Rock (City) and the Arkansas Department of Transportation (ARDOT) are co-permittees under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit ARS000002 (Permit) in accordance with the Arkansas Water and Air Pollution Control Act and the Clean Water Act. The purpose of the Permit is to outline the activities required for ARDOT and the City of Little Rock to lawfully discharge waters from within the territorial boundaries of the City via the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) into the Arkansas River and its tributaries.  Compliance with the terms of the permit is assured by the adoption of storm water quality management plans (SWQMP) which provide guidance on best practices to mitigate the pollution of waterways to the maximum extent practicable (MEP). The Permit became effective 2012-04-01 and is currently administratively effective at the time of this report.

Each section of this report follows the reporting requirements as identified in section 6.9 of the Permit. For clarity, the requirements as given in the permit are shown in quotes, followed by a description of compliance activity associated with the requirement. Where separate reporting by the co-permittees is required, subsections for each permittee are provided.

**Requirement**:
>Annual Report - Each co-permittee shall contribute to the preparation of an annual system-wide report to be submitted by April 1 of each year between the effective date of the permit and the date of expiration. The report shall be in the form as outlined in the SWQMP and shall include the following separate sections, with an overview for the entire MS4 and subsections for the co-permittees where applicable.
Preparation and submittal of a system-wide annual report shall be conducted by the co-permittees. The report shall indicate if the co-permittees have failed to provide required information on the portions of the MS4 for which they are responsible. The co-permittees shall be responsible for timely submittal of the system-wide report. Each co-permittee shall be responsible for content of the report relating to the portions of the MS4 for which it is responsible, and for failure to provide information for the system-wide annual report. Each co-permittee shall sign and certify their portion of the annual report.

# 2.0 Executive Summary<a name="2.0-Executive-Summary"></a>
The City and ARDOT have provided policies and ordinances to ensure compliance with the City of Little Rock NPDES permit. The City provides quarterly reports of water quality within various tributaries of the Arkansas River, and these reports do not appear to indicate a trend toward either improvement or deterioration of water quality. ARDOT and the City provide enforcement of policies, inspections, maintenance, monitoring and public education to promote the health of the MS4. These activities include hundreds of miles of storm sewer maintenance, thousands of miles of street maintenance, dozens of public outreach activities and partnerships with volunteers and non-profit organizations. In 2018, these programs cost approximately  $25 million in direct and administrative expenses. Both ARDOT and the City operate under a SWQMP which has provided effective controls for maintaining the quality of surface waters within Little Rock.

### Inspections<a name="Inspections"></a>

The City Public Works inspects both private and public construction projects for compliance with NPDES requirements. Publicly funded construction projects are inspected at or near a daily basis while private construction projects under Public Works issued permits are inspected periodically as well as following requests, complaints or prior to issuance of certificates of occupancy.

### Education<a name="Education"></a>

The City Public Works serves as a repository of information for the Public for topics of water quality and the MS4. Brochures, graphic material and staff are made available to the public Monday through Friday during normal business hours. Supplemental information is provided on the City website. Public outreach pertaining to water quality is disseminated frequently by the City Sustainability Commission and their partner organizations. The City Mayor has made sustainability a priority for the City Public Works department and the public-private partnerships they have facilitated have taken the lead in public education.

*Sustainability Commission*
The Mayor’s Sustainability Commission was established in 2008 to advise the City on sustainable practices. Since that time, the Commission has worked with various groups in the City to develop new environmentally green policies that have positively impacted city government and the residents of Little Rock.

*LRTV*
Little Rock TV (LRTV) is a municipal government access channel where the City of Little Rock is able to broadcast public service information as well as televised events to the general public. LRTV has in its program rotation several advertisements related to public education about water quality. The rotation is similar to a slideshow with billboards cycling at 15 to 20 second intervals. The storm water education billboards run inside of of loops 15 to 60 minutes long run 23-24 times per day. The total runtime of these billboards in 2018 would be 36-148 minutes. Examples of the water quality billboards are given in appendix FIXME. Also, as of February 2019, LRTV has included in its programming a short educational video from University of Arkansas Research and Extension (UAEX) entitled *If It Rains It Drains!*

*Parks and Recreation*

Additionally, many of the open channels and waterways of the MS4 are within municipal parks. The 49 employees of the Parks and Recreation department provide intensive maintainenance, including litter removal and mowing, of the 4,200 acres of developed park land and also monitor and maintain the 1,900 acres of undeveloped parks with the City of Little Rock.

The City Parks and Recreation department provides weekly as well as post-event maintenance of War Memorial Park, which includes the ponds along Coleman Creek. Parks and Recreation has removed sediments and organic matter from the floor of the pond once in 2004 and again in 2009 to preserve fish habitat. The discharge from these ponds is also naturally filtered by the bioswale located downstream of a splash pad within the park. At MacArthur Park, the City Parks and Recreation department has performed monthly sampling of the pond with the assistance of the Arkansas Health Department to measure the efficacy of their campaign to reduce public feeding of geese. The data is not sufficient to demonstrate change of the water quality within the pond; however, continued monitoring is planned for the following year. A summary of results is shown below.

## 3.13.2 Little Rock Construction Runoff Reduction<a name="3.13.2-Little-Rock-Construction-Runoff-Reduction"></a>
The City’s program for reducing construction site runoff is a combination of monitoring and administrative controls which are written in the SWQMP and codified in Chapter 29 of the City of Little Rock Code of Ordinances. Construction and land alteration activities are subject to permitting by the City, and as a condition of these permits, construction activities must provide plans for erosion control, drainage and NPDES compliance where applicable. Significant land alteration activities are unlawful without a grading permit, except where allowed by Chapter 29 of City code.

In addition to submitting plans for City approval, construction activity is subject to inspection by City staff. Inspections are conducted periodically as well as prior to issuance of certificates of occupancy and any construction or land alteration activity which does not provide adequate erosion controls is subject to stop work orders and other penalties.

In 2018, the City of Little Rock Public Works permitted 117 construction projects, which disturbed a total area of 5100 acres. The result of these land alteration activities is predicted to cumulatively reduce soil loss by 4900 tons/acre/year. A list of all permitted projects is provided in appendix H.

## 3.18 Changes to SWQMP Review<a name="3.18-Changes-to-SWQMP-Review"></a>
**Requirement:**
> Program Modification: The approved SWQMP shall not be modified by the co-permittees without the prior approval of the Director, unless in accordance with the items below:
- Portions of the SWQMP not specifically required by 6.2 may be modified upon written notification to the permitting authority.
- Modifications adding (but not subtracting or replacing) components, controls, or requirements to the approved SWQMP may be made by the co-permittees at any time upon written notification to the permitting authority.
- Modifications made under this paragraph shall not become enforceable permit conditions until such time as the modifications are formally approved.
- Modification requests and notifications shall be signed and shall include a certification that the co-permittees were given an opportunity to comment on proposed changes.

The co-permittees must review and revise the City of Little Rock and Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department SWQMP to ensure compliance with the requirement to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the Maximum Extent Practicable (MEP) as contained in Section 402(p)(3)(B)(iii) of the Clean Water Act. Specifically, the co-permittees must review and revise the SWQMP sections regarding construction site runoff and public education. The co-permittees shall conduct a review of the current SWQMP and shall revise the SWQMP to include additional BMPs regarding public education and construction site runoff particularly, these revisions will include notification of ADEQ’s NPDES permitting program to construction sites, institute an employee education program, increase public education, increase the frequency of construction site inspections, and notify ADEQ Enforcement Section of construction sites that do not have erosion controls installed. The co-permittees shall submit to ADEQ their suggested revisions to the SWQMP within eleven (11) months following the effective date of the permit.
ARDOT and the City of Little Rock do not propose any changes to the SWQMP at this time.

# 4.0 Conclusions<a name="4.0-Conclusions"></a>
ARDOT has expended a significant amount of money and personnel resources on such things as personnel training, litter collection, maintenance and repair of the drainage system, and other activities detailed in Section 2.1.  While there is no way to measure the impact of these measures on the quality of surface water within the MS4 area, the Department believes the controls implemented are effective.
The City of Little Rock values the quality of water within its territorial boundaries for the welfare of its residents and the local environment. Through the application of administrative and engineering controls, the resources and manpower spent on maintenance and upkeep of the MS4, and the training of personnel and promotion of public awareness, the City has managed to protect the quality of its waters. Continued application of existing policies and ordinances is expected to maintain the water quality within Little Rock.
