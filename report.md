The City of Little Rock (City) and the Arkansas Department of Transportation (ARDOT) are co-permittees under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit ARS000002 (Permit) in accordance with the Arkansas Water and Air Pollution Control Act and the Clean Water Act. The purpose of the Permit is to outline the activities required for ARDOT and the City of Little Rock to lawfully discharge waters from within the territorial boundaries of the City via the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) into the Arkansas River and its tributaries.  Compliance with the terms of the permit is assured by the adoption of storm water quality management plans (SWQMP) which provide guidance on best practices to mitigate the pollution of waterways to the maximum extent practicable (MEP). The Permit became effective 2012-04-01 and is currently administratively effective at the time of this report.

Each section of this report follows the reporting requirements as identified in section 6.9 of the Permit. For clarity, the requirements as given in the permit are shown in quotes, followed by a description of compliance activity associated with the requirement. Where separate reporting by the co-permittees is required, subsections for each permittee are provided.

**Requirement**:

The report shall be in the form as outlined in the SWQMP and shall include the following separate sections, with an overview for the entire MS4 and subsections for the co-permittees where applicable.
Preparation and submittal of a system-wide annual report shall be conducted by the co-permittees. The report shall indicate if the co-permittees have failed to provide required information on the portions of the MS4 for which they are responsible. The co-permittees shall be responsible for timely submittal of the system-wide report. Each co-permittee shall be responsible for content of the report relating to the portions of the MS4 for which it is responsible, and for failure to provide information for the system-wide annual report. Each co-permittee shall sign and certify their portion of the annual report.

# 2.0 Executive Summary
The City and ARDOT have provided policies and ordinances to ensure compliance with the City of Little Rock NPDES permit. The City provides quarterly reports of water quality within various tributaries of the Arkansas River, and these reports do not appear to indicate a trend toward either improvement or deterioration of water quality. ARDOT and the City provide enforcement of policies, inspections, maintenance, monitoring and public education to promote the health of the MS4. These activities include hundreds of miles of storm sewer maintenance, thousands of miles of street maintenance, dozens of public outreach activities and partnerships with volunteers and non-profit organizations. In 2018, these programs cost approximately  $25 million in direct and administrative expenses. Both ARDOT and the City operate under a SWQMP which has provided effective controls for maintaining the quality of surface waters within Little Rock.

## 3.13.2 Little Rock Construction Runoff Reduction
The City’s program for reducing construction site runoff is a combination of monitoring and administrative controls which are written in the SWQMP and codified in Chapter 29 of the City of Little Rock Code of Ordinances. Construction and land alteration activities are subject to permitting by the City, and as a condition of these permits, construction activities must provide plans for erosion control, drainage and NPDES compliance where applicable. Significant land alteration activities are unlawful without a grading permit, except where allowed by Chapter 29 of City code.

In addition to submitting plans for City approval, construction activity is subject to inspection by City staff. Inspections are conducted periodically as well as prior to issuance of certificates of occupancy and any construction or land alteration activity which does not provide adequate erosion controls is subject to stop work orders and other penalties.

In 2018, the City of Little Rock Public Works permitted 117 construction projects, which disturbed a total area of 5100 acres. The result of these land alteration activities is predicted to cumulatively reduce soil loss by 4900 tons/acre/year. A list of all permitted projects is provided in appendix H.

## 3.14 Changes to Roles and Responsibility
**Requirement:**
>An update on Roles and Responsibility if applicable.

ARDOT and the City of Little Rock report no changes to roles and responsibility.

## 3.15 Monitoring and Reporting

## 3.15.1 Representative Monitoring
**Requirement:**
>Representative Monitoring: Monitoring shall be conducted on representative outfalls, internal sampling stations, and/or in-stream monitoring locations to characterize the quality of stormwater discharges from the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System.

The locations of sampled outfalls are given by the Permit and are believed to be representative of water quality within the MS4. Grab samples of storm water are collected only by qualified personnel and analyzed by ADEQ accredited labs. Quarterly reports are reviewed by City staff authorized in accordance with the Permit.

## 3.15.2 Storm Event Data
**Requirement:**
>Storm Event Data: Quantitative data shall be collected to estimate pollutant loadings and event mean concentrations for each parameter sampled. Records shall be maintained of all analytical results, the date and duration of the storm event sampled: rainfall measurements or estimates of the storm event which generated the sampled runoff; the duration between storm events sampled and the end of the previous measurable storm event; and an estimate of the total volume of the discharge sampled.

All discharge samples were collected during rain events which exceeded 0.1in of precipitation. The measured precipitation in the table below is an average of six ground weather stations within the limits of the City of Little Rock. The time between acquiring samples and the most recent rain event vary from one to six days. Approximately eight liters of water is required for the battery of laboratory tests performed. In total, approximately 160 liters of runoff was sampled during 2018. The City holds records of all reported samples.

## 3.15.3 Sampling
**Requirement:**
>Grab Samples: Grab Samples shall be taken during the first two hours of discharge.

Representative Storm Events: Samples shall be collected from the discharge resulting from a storm event that is greater than 0.1 inches in magnitude and that occurs at least 72 hours from the previously measurable storm event.
Throughout 2018, the City has a contractual agreement with Environmental Services Company, Inc. for the collection, analysis and reporting of storm water samples. Samples are collected quarterly during rain events from five outfall locations as specified in NPDES permit ARS000002.

Reporting is provided electronically through the Environmental Protection Agency’s NETDMR service.  Electronic reports are certified by an authorized representative of the City.

## 3.15.4 Seasonal Loadings and Event Mean Concentrations
**Requirement:**
>Seasonal Loadings and Event Mean Concentrations: Data shall be maintained to provide estimates for each major outfall of seasonal pollutant loadings and event mean concentrations for a representative storm event for the parameters which the co-permittees must monitor. This information may be estimated from the monitoring results and shall take into consideration land uses and drainage areas for the outfall.

A seasonal trend analysis is given in appendix F.

## 3.16 Changes to Legal Authority
**Requirement:**
>An update on Legal Authority if applicable.

ARDOT and the City of Little Rock report no changes to legal authority.

## 3.17 Changes to SWQMP Resources
**Requirement:**
>An update on SWQMP Resources if applicable.

ARDOT and the City of Little Rock report no changes to SWQMP resources.

## 3.18 Changes to SWQMP Review
**Requirement:**
> Program Modification: The approved SWQMP shall not be modified by the co-permittees without the prior approval of the Director, unless in accordance with the items below:
- Portions of the SWQMP not specifically required by 6.2 may be modified upon written notification to the permitting authority.
- Modifications adding (but not subtracting or replacing) components, controls, or requirements to the approved SWQMP may be made by the co-permittees at any time upon written notification to the permitting authority.
- Modifications made under this paragraph shall not become enforceable permit conditions until such time as the modifications are formally approved.
- Modification requests and notifications shall be signed and shall include a certification that the co-permittees were given an opportunity to comment on proposed changes.

The co-permittees must review and revise the City of Little Rock and Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department SWQMP to ensure compliance with the requirement to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the Maximum Extent Practicable (MEP) as contained in Section 402(p)(3)(B)(iii) of the Clean Water Act. Specifically, the co-permittees must review and revise the SWQMP sections regarding construction site runoff and public education. The co-permittees shall conduct a review of the current SWQMP and shall revise the SWQMP to include additional BMPs regarding public education and construction site runoff particularly, these revisions will include notification of ADEQ’s NPDES permitting program to construction sites, institute an employee education program, increase public education, increase the frequency of construction site inspections, and notify ADEQ Enforcement Section of construction sites that do not have erosion controls installed. The co-permittees shall submit to ADEQ their suggested revisions to the SWQMP within eleven (11) months following the effective date of the permit.
ARDOT and the City of Little Rock do not propose any changes to the SWQMP at this time.

# 4.0 Conclusions
ARDOT has expended a significant amount of money and personnel resources on such things as personnel training, litter collection, maintenance and repair of the drainage system, and other activities detailed in Section 2.1.  While there is no way to measure the impact of these measures on the quality of surface water within the MS4 area, the Department believes the controls implemented are effective.
The City of Little Rock values the quality of water within its territorial boundaries for the welfare of its residents and the local environment. Through the application of administrative and engineering controls, the resources and manpower spent on maintenance and upkeep of the MS4, and the training of personnel and promotion of public awareness, the City has managed to protect the quality of its waters. Continued application of existing policies and ordinances is expected to maintain the water quality within Little Rock.
