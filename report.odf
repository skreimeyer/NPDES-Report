<p>The City of Little Rock (City) and the Arkansas Department of Transportation (ARDOT) are co-permittees under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit ARS000002 (Permit) in accordance with the Arkansas Water and Air Pollution Control Act and the Clean Water Act. The purpose of the Permit is to outline the activities required for ARDOT and the City of Little Rock to lawfully discharge waters from within the territorial boundaries of the City via the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) into the Arkansas River and its tributaries. Compliance with the terms of the permit is assured by the adoption of storm water quality management plans (SWQMP) which provide guidance on best practices to mitigate the pollution of waterways to the maximum extent practicable (MEP). The Permit became effective 2012-04-01 and is currently administratively effective at the time of this report.</p>
<p>Each section of this report follows the reporting requirements as identified in section 6.9 of the Permit. For clarity, the requirements as given in the permit are shown in quotes, followed by a description of compliance activity associated with the requirement. Where separate reporting by the co-permittees is required, subsections for each permittee are provided.</p>
<p><strong>Requirement</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Annual Report - Each co-permittee shall contribute to the preparation of an annual system-wide report to be submitted by April 1 of each year between the effective date of the permit and the date of expiration. The report shall be in the form as outlined in the SWQMP and shall include the following separate sections, with an overview for the entire MS4 and subsections for the co-permittees where applicable. Preparation and submittal of a system-wide annual report shall be conducted by the co-permittees. The report shall indicate if the co-permittees have failed to provide required information on the portions of the MS4 for which they are responsible. The co-permittees shall be responsible for timely submittal of the system-wide report. Each co-permittee shall be responsible for content of the report relating to the portions of the MS4 for which it is responsible, and for failure to provide information for the system-wide annual report. Each co-permittee shall sign and certify their portion of the annual report.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="executive-summary">2.0 Executive Summary<a name="2.0-Executive-Summary"></a></h1>
<p>The City and ARDOT have provided policies and ordinances to ensure compliance with the City of Little Rock NPDES permit. The City provides quarterly reports of water quality within various tributaries of the Arkansas River, and these reports do not appear to indicate a trend toward either improvement or deterioration of water quality. ARDOT and the City provide enforcement of policies, inspections, maintenance, monitoring and public education to promote the health of the MS4. These activities include hundreds of miles of storm sewer maintenance, thousands of miles of street maintenance, dozens of public outreach activities and partnerships with volunteers and non-profit organizations. In 2018, these programs cost approximately $25 million in direct and administrative expenses. Both ARDOT and the City operate under a SWQMP which has provided effective controls for maintaining the quality of surface waters within Little Rock.</p>

<p>ARDOT costs to implement with SWMP part of the general operating budget are anticipated to be approximately $900,000 for the upcoming permit year. ARDOT has 3 crews with a total of 58 personnel dedicated to working in the Little Rock metropolitan area that have an annual salary of approximately $1,948,000. These crews can be supported by other crews that are assigned as needed throughout District Six.</p>
<p>City maintenance of the MS4 is paid for by the City Street Fund and is tasked to the 215 employees of the Public Works. In 2018 $8.6 million was budgeted for the maintenance expenses of streets and storm drains, which is expected to become $8.4 million in 2019. Administrative expenses of the Public Works, which includes overhead costs necessary for administration of the NPDES permit, where $4 million in 2018 to $4.9 million in 2019. The City also invests in its storm drainage infrastructure through capital improvement projects financed by sales tax. These improvements are financed in 3-year cycles, with 2018 falling into the 2015-2018 cycle. $2.8 million is spent on each of the seven wards for a total estimated expense of $19.9 million of capital improvements, which include municipal drainage improvements. The City is also the beneficiary of a water quality grant from the Arkansas Natural Resources Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency for the construction of low impact development improvements on Main Street from Markham to Capitol Avenue. $1.4 million is expected to be spent in 2019.</p>
<p>Operations and maintenance costs of the MS4 are met by the City Street Fund. These expenses are summarized in the table below.</p>

<p>The City Public Works inspects both private and public construction projects for compliance with NPDES requirements. Publicly funded construction projects are inspected at or near a daily basis while private construction projects under Public Works issued permits are inspected periodically as well as following requests, complaints or prior to issuance of certificates of occupancy.</p>
<h3 id="education">Education<a name="Education"></a></h3>
<p>The City Public Works serves as a repository of information for the Public for topics of water quality and the MS4. Brochures, graphic material and staff are made available to the public Monday through Friday during normal business hours. Supplemental information is provided on the City website. Public outreach pertaining to water quality is disseminated frequently by the City Sustainability Commission and their partner organizations. The City Mayor has made sustainability a priority for the City Public Works department and the public-private partnerships they have facilitated have taken the lead in public education.</p>
<p><em>Sustainability Commission</em> The Mayor’s Sustainability Commission was established in 2008 to advise the City on sustainable practices. Since that time, the Commission has worked with various groups in the City to develop new environmentally green policies that have positively impacted city government and the residents of Little Rock.</p>

<p><em>Private Partners</em> Non-government organizations assist the City with meeting its water quality goals directly through cleanups, such as Friends of Fourche Creek (FoFC) and the Keep Little Rock Beautiful (KLRB), as well as promotional and educational activity. FoFC regularly communicates with the public about floatables and othe risks to waterways through Facebook and television and radio interviews. With a small grant from the City of Little Rock Public Works, Audubon Arkansas has produced a children's coloring book with educational material about the importance of our waterways which has been distributed to the following locations:</p>

<p>Additionally, many of the open channels and waterways of the MS4 are within municipal parks. The 49 employees of the Parks and Recreation department provide intensive maintainenance, including litter removal and mowing, of the 4,200 acres of developed park land and also monitor and maintain the 1,900 acres of undeveloped parks with the City of Little Rock.</p>
<p>The City Parks and Recreation department provides weekly as well as post-event maintenance of War Memorial Park, which includes the ponds along Coleman Creek. Parks and Recreation has removed sediments and organic matter from the floor of the pond once in 2004 and again in 2009 to preserve fish habitat. The discharge from these ponds is also naturally filtered by the bioswale located downstream of a splash pad within the park. At MacArthur Park, the City Parks and Recreation department has performed monthly sampling of the pond with the assistance of the Arkansas Health Department to measure the efficacy of their campaign to reduce public feeding of geese. The data is not sufficient to demonstrate change of the water quality within the pond; however, continued monitoring is planned for the following year. A summary of results is shown below.</p>

<h2 id="little-rock-construction-runoff-reduction">3.13.2 Little Rock Construction Runoff Reduction<a name="3.13.2-Little-Rock-Construction-Runoff-Reduction"></a></h2>
<p>The City’s program for reducing construction site runoff is a combination of monitoring and administrative controls which are written in the SWQMP and codified in Chapter 29 of the City of Little Rock Code of Ordinances. Construction and land alteration activities are subject to permitting by the City, and as a condition of these permits, construction activities must provide plans for erosion control, drainage and NPDES compliance where applicable. Significant land alteration activities are unlawful without a grading permit, except where allowed by Chapter 29 of City code.</p>
<p>In addition to submitting plans for City approval, construction activity is subject to inspection by City staff. Inspections are conducted periodically as well as prior to issuance of certificates of occupancy and any construction or land alteration activity which does not provide adequate erosion controls is subject to stop work orders and other penalties.</p>
<p>In 2018, the City of Little Rock Public Works permitted 117 construction projects, which disturbed a total area of 543 acres. The result of these land alteration activities is predicted to cumulatively reduce soil loss by 4900 tons/acre/year. A list of all permitted projects is provided in appendix H.</p>

<p><strong>Requirement:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Representative Monitoring: Monitoring shall be conducted on representative outfalls, internal sampling stations, and/or in-stream monitoring locations to characterize the quality of stormwater discharges from the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The locations of sampled outfalls are given by the Permit and are believed to be representative of water quality within the MS4. Grab samples of storm water are collected only by qualified personnel and analyzed by ADEQ accredited labs. Quarterly reports are reviewed by City staff authorized in accordance with the Permit.</p>
<h2 id="storm-event-data">3.15.2 Storm Event Data<a name="3.15.2-Storm-Event-Data"></a></h2>
<p><strong>Requirement:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Storm Event Data: Quantitative data shall be collected to estimate pollutant loadings and event mean concentrations for each parameter sampled. Records shall be maintained of all analytical results, the date and duration of the storm event sampled: rainfall measurements or estimates of the storm event which generated the sampled runoff; the duration between storm events sampled and the end of the previous measurable storm event; and an estimate of the total volume of the discharge sampled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All discharge samples were collected during rain events which exceeded 0.1in of precipitation. The measured precipitation in the table below is an average of six ground weather stations within the limits of the City of Little Rock. The time between acquiring samples and the most recent rain event vary from one to six days. Approximately eight liters of water is required for the battery of laboratory tests performed. In total, approximately 160 liters of runoff was sampled during 2018. The City holds records of all reported samples.</p>

<h1 id="conclusions">4.0 Conclusions<a name="4.0-Conclusions"></a></h1>
<p>ARDOT has expended a significant amount of money and personnel resources on such things as personnel training, litter collection, maintenance and repair of the drainage system, and other activities detailed in Section 2.1. While there is no way to measure the impact of these measures on the quality of surface water within the MS4 area, the Department believes the controls implemented are effective. The City of Little Rock values the quality of water within its territorial boundaries for the welfare of its residents and the local environment. Through the application of administrative and engineering controls, the resources and manpower spent on maintenance and upkeep of the MS4, and the training of personnel and promotion of public awareness, the City has managed to protect the quality of its waters. Continued application of existing policies and ordinances is expected to maintain the water quality within Little Rock.</p>
